        <h2>Silly Citizens</h2>
        <p>I find humor in the fact that people actually waste their time worrying about my existence. Here is a video that was filmed by citizens in my area, as a warning to beware of the <em>"Kupcake Killer"</em>. It's only cool when I say it. What a waste of their time...Have they forgotten that I subsist on <em>cupcakes</em>, and not humans?</p?>

    	<p>To me, this video is just completely ludicrous. I can't believe that people went out of their ways to compile this biased video of me. Not only is it inaccurately portraying me, but it's also <em>poorly</em> made. Ugh. Silly, stupid citizens.</p>
